- Staking contract
  - stack
  - unstack how much they have staked for that habit
  - isCompleted (done)
  - isCompleted as modifier
  - fallback and recieve

issue to be addressed rn
  - staking function's amount parameter is not storing msg.value hence, i am not able to send token to contract
  - deploy contract for the first time when user onboard, then create habit within that contract
